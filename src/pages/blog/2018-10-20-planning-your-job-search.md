**Plan your job search**

When it comes to finding your dream job, the first step is to figure out what the ‘dream’ actually is. We know that’s much easier said than done, but don’t worry, we’ll help you to figure it out.

To start with, you’ve got three broad options:

* Staying in the same type of role, in the same industry
* Looking for a similar, role but in a different sector
* A complete change of role, self-employment, or an alternative lifestyle

Even if you’re planning on staying in the same kind of job, it’s important to be able to recognise the right choice when it comes along. If you’re looking for a career overhaul, it’s even more important to think carefully about your options.

**Finding what works for you**

We love the fact that everyone we work with is so downright different. You’re a diverse bunch when it comes to your interests, what motivates you, and what work means to you. That’s why you need to think carefully about what makes a role right for you.

**Consider your broader lifestyle:**

* Your ideal work-life balance
* Your commitments
* Your financial requirements
* Your preferences
* Assessing your options

We’re big believers that you can do anything you put your mind to, but you do need to give some real thought to what you’re good at, the sort of environment you want to work in, and what you want to achieve in your career.

Think about where your strengths lie, and what you’re looking for:

* Review your skills, values and work style
* Identify your interests (e.g. practical, investigative, artistic, social, or enterprising)
* Think about what you want from a role
* Landing the right role to suit your lifestyle

There are so many different options out there when it comes to your working pattern. Some of us take comfort in the routine and security of 9-5; others love the freedom and changing pace of something less fixed. But much of the time, it’s your commitments and lifestyle that determine your course.



Think about the options open to you:

* Permanent (either full or part-time)
* Contract (temporary work or fixed-term)
* Self-employment (consultancy, interim management, non executive directorships, setting up your own business, buying a business, running a franchise)
* Portfolio (several part-time roles, sometimes with self-employment or voluntary work)
* Working abroad
* Alternative lifestyles (retirement, voluntary work, charity work)
* Researching your options



Once you’ve defined your ideal role and working style, make a wish list of brands you admire and industries that interest you. Think big, but be realistic, including smaller local businesses that could offer a valuable foot in the door. Consider practical elements like how far you’re willing to commute, the cost of travel and whether you’re looking for short-term experience or lasting career opportunities.

**Then refine your search to learn:**

* The kind of organisations that need your skills
* Which types of roles these companies offer
* The different lifestyle and employment options available to you
* It’s also worth speaking to experts in your ideal area, so tap your contacts for the real life story.<https://www.office-angels.com/jobseekers/advice-for-jobseekers/planning-your-job-search>
