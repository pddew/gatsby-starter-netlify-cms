**Immediate-start is on a mission to make it online-hiring accessible for everyone.**

We believe the current jobs industry has a trust-problem, and over-crowded with clunky, expensive and sites that don't work. 

We want to fix this problem, with free, easy and privacy-focussed products.

## Free

Old-school 'pay and pray' job boards charge you up front and hope your ad performs. Many will try to sell you upgrades that don't work.

Our way: Adverts are free! If you want an extra boost, we do have [paid upgrades](https://immediate-start.com/products/) with guaranteed performance.

## Easy

Old-school boards are a pain. You need to register, verify, fill out long complicated forms and then fend off sales calls.

Our way: Simply click 'post a job' and fill one form, whatever your device. Easy!

## Private

Other boards want as much data on you as they can get; for advertising, sales calls and everything else.

Our way: We'd rather not have it, and only ask for and keep what we need to bring you candidates.
